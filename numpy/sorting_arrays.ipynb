For a list of *N* values, it requires *N* loops, each of which does on order *~N* comparisons to find the swap value. In terms of the \"big-O\" notation often used to characterize these algorithms, selection fort averages *O\\[N2\\]:* if you double the number of items in the list, the execution time will go up by about a factor of four.\n",
