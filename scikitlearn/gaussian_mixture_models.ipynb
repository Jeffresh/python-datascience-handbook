    "# Gaussian Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The *k-means* clustering model explored int he previous section is simple and relatively easy to understand, but its simplicity leads to practical callenges in its application. In particular, the non-probabilistic nature of *k-means* and its use of simple distance-from cluster-center to assign cluster membership leads to ppor performance ofr many real-world situations. In this section we will take a look at Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), which can be viewed as an extension of the ideas behidn *k-means*, bu can also be a poweful tool for estimation beyond simple clustering.\n",
