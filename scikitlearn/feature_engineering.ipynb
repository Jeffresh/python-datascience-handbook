    "The previous sections outline the fundamental ideas of machine learning, but all fo the exmaples assume that you have numerical data in a tidy, `[n_samples, n_features]` format. In the real world, data rarely comes in such a form. With this in mind, one of the more important steps in using machine learning in practice is *feature engineering*: that is, taking whatever information you have about your problem and turning it into numbers that you can use to build your feature matrix.\n",

    "features  for representing *categorical data*, features for representing *text*, and *features* for representing *images*. Additionally, we will discuss *derived features* for increasing model complexity and *imputation* of missin data. Often this process is known as *vectorization*, as it involves converting arbitratry data into well-behaved vectors."
