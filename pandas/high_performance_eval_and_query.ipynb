    "# High-Performance Pandas: eval() and query()\n",
    "\n",
    "As we´ve already seen in previous sections, the power of the PyData stack is built upong the ability of NumPy and Pandas to push basic operations into C via and intuitive syntax: examples are vectorized/broadcasted operations in NumPy, and grouping-type operations in Pandas. While these abstractions are efficient and effective for many common use cases, they often rely on the creation of temporary intermediate objects, which can cause undue overhead in computational time and memory use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas includes some experimental tools that allow you to directly access C-speed operations without costly allocation of intermediate arrays. These are the `eval()` and `query()` functions, which rely on the [Numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) package. In this notebook we will walk through their use and give some rules-of-thumb about when you might think about using them."
