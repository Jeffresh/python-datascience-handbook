    "The difference between data found in many tutorials and data in the real world is that real-world data is rarely clean and homogeneous. In particular, many interesting datasets will have some amount of data missing. To make matters even more complicated, different data sources may indicate missing data in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss some general considerations for missing data, discuss how Pandas chooses to represent it, and demosntrate some built-in Pandas tools for handling missing data in Python. Here and throughout the book, we'll refer to missing data in general as *null*, *NaN*, or *NA* values."

    "## Trade-Offs in Missing Data Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of schemes that have been developed to indicate the presence of missing data in a table or DataFrame. Generally, they revolve around one of two strategies: using a *mask* that globally indicates missing values, or choosing a *sentinel value* that indicates a missing entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the masking approach, the mask might be an entirely separate Boolean array, or it may involve appropriation of one bit in the data representation to locally indicate the null status of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sentinel approach, the sentinvel value could be some data-specific convention, such as indicating a missing einteger value with -9999 or some rare bit pattern, or it could be a more global convention, such as indicating a missing floating-point value with NaN, a special value which is part of the IEEE floating-point specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these approaches is without trade-offs: use of a separate mask array requires allocation of an additional Boolean array, which adds overhead in both storage and computation. A sentinel value reduces the range of valid values that can be represented, and may require extra (often non-optimized) logic in CPU and GPU arithmetic. Common special values like NaN are not available for all data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in most cases where no universally optimal choice exists, different languages and system use different conventions. For example, the R language uses reserved big patterns within each data type as sentinel values indicating missing data, while the SciDB system uses an extra byte attached to every cell which indicates a NA state."
