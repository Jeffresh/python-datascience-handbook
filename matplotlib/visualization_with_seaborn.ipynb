    "# Visualization with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several valid complaitns about Matploblit that often come up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defaults are not exaclty the best choices.\n",
    "- Is relatively low level. Doing sophisticated statistical visualization is poissible, but requires a *lot* of boiler plate code.\n",
    "- Is not designed for use with `DataFrame`s. In order to visualize data from Pandas you must extract each `Series` and often concatenate them together into the right format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to these problems is Seaborn. Seaborn provides an API on top of Matplotlib.\n",
    "Matplotlib is addresing this: it has recently added in `plt.style` but SEaborn remains an extremely useful addon."
