    "# Visualizing Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "For any scientific measurement, accurate accounting for errors is nearly as important, if not more important, than accurate reporting of the number itself. For example, imagine that I am using some astrophysical observations to estimate the Hubble Constant, the local measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. I known that the current literature suggests a value of around 71 (km/s)Mpc, and I measure a value of 74(km/s) Mpc with my method. Are the values consistent? The only correct answer, given this information, is this: there is no way to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I augment this information with reported uncertainties: the current literature suggests a value of around 71+- 2.5(km/s) Mpc, and my method has measured a value of 74 +- 5(km/s)Mpc. Now are the values consistent? That is a question that can be quantitatively answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In visualization of data and results, showing these errors effectively can make a plot convey much more complete information."
